In computational research involving simulations which sweep over a large parameter space, it is often required to create large number of scripts for each of the parameter values. To reduce the time spent in manually creating scripts, automating the process can be achieved with utilizing the "numpy" library in python. Consider this example: There is a base script "simulation.py" which has to be generated for the parameters "A" and "B" taking on values {1,2,3} and {4,5,6} respectively. These values require the user to create 9 scripts in total for all the combinations of values of A and B. Utilizing the "meshgrid" function in numpy, we can easily generate these 9 combinations without having to explicitly code the two nested "for" loops. The advantage is "meshgrid" can work with more than two parameters as well and so, if in future there is another parameter "C" which is added, the method will work without having to add another "for" loop in the pipeline.
The goal of this project would be to create a command line utility which will do the following:
- Read parameter names and values from an excel sheet. The parameters having multiple values will have those in a comma separated format.
- Create the appropriate number of scripts, with all possible combinations of the parameters to be swept over. The user will provide the excel sheet path and the base script path as arguments.
